# Motorcycles-website
A website that takes some basic input from the user concerning their preferences for a motorcycle and returns a list of recomendations. Motorcycle lists and recomendations are generated through vanila javascript. User input is saved in local storage. 

## Things to do 
while questions are weighted differently, answers aren't. So if you want a super fast bike, slowest bike will be recomended just as much as a moderetly fast bike. 

Arent enough bikes! I chose my favorites but should at least double the ammout to make survey more usefull and underline some differences

Should add a small discription to individual motorcycles.
